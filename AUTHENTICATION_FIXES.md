# üîê Authentication Fixes Implemented

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. **Session Configuration Enhanced**
- Added proper session security settings for production
- Configured `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` for HTTPS
- Added `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True` to prevent XSS
- Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'` for CSRF protection
- Configured `PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = 3600` (1 hour)

### 2. **Token Refresh Mechanism Added**
- Implemented automatic token refresh in both `main.py` and `playlist_routes.py`
- Added `refresh_access_token()` function that uses refresh tokens
- Tokens are automatically refreshed when they expire within 5 minutes
- Enhanced session persistence with `session.permanent = True`

### 3. **Improved Authentication Checking**
- Updated `require_auth()` to check token expiration and refresh automatically
- Enhanced `/auth/user-info` endpoint with token refresh capability
- Added comprehensive token expiration handling

### 4. **Better Error Handling**
- Enhanced Spotify API error responses with more descriptive messages
- Added specific handling for 401 (expired token) and 403 (insufficient permissions) errors
- Improved user-facing error messages in playlist creation

### 5. **Session Storage Improvements**
- Made sessions permanent for better persistence across requests
- Added proper token expiration tracking
- Enhanced session data structure for better reliability

## üîß Configuration Updates Made

### Environment Variables
‚úÖ `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=https://www.dreamify.ing/callback` (Updated)
‚úÖ Vercel environment variables updated via CLI

### Application Updates
‚úÖ Main authentication flow enhanced with token refresh
‚úÖ Playlist creation route improved with better token validation
‚úÖ Session configuration optimized for production
‚úÖ Deployed to production successfully

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL NEXT STEP REQUIRED**

### üéØ **UPDATE SPOTIFY DEVELOPER DASHBOARD** (HIGH PRIORITY)

**You MUST update your Spotify App Settings in the Developer Dashboard:**

1. **Go to:** [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. **Navigate to:** Your App ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Redirect URIs
3. **Add:** `https://www.dreamify.ing/callback`
4. **Save** the changes

**Current Issue:** Users are still getting authentication errors because Spotify is rejecting the redirect URI that isn't registered in your app settings.

## üîç **Testing Steps After Spotify Dashboard Update**

1. Visit https://www.dreamify.ing
2. Click "Login with Spotify"
3. Complete OAuth flow (should redirect properly now)
4. Try creating a playlist
5. Verify token refresh works by waiting and trying again

## üìä **Monitoring Points**

- Watch for "Token refresh" messages in logs
- Monitor session persistence across requests  
- Check for any remaining 401 errors in playlist creation
- Verify authentication state maintains properly

## üöÄ **Expected Outcomes**

After updating the Spotify Developer Dashboard:
- ‚úÖ Custom domain authentication flow will work seamlessly
- ‚úÖ Token refresh will handle expired sessions automatically
- ‚úÖ Users won't get "Not authenticated" errors during playlist creation
- ‚úÖ Session persistence will be improved across requests
- ‚úÖ Better error messages for troubleshooting

## üìù **Code Changes Summary**

### Files Modified:
- `src/main.py` - Enhanced session config and token refresh
- `src/routes/playlist_routes.py` - Added token validation and refresh
- `src/routes/auth_routes.py` - Improved user info endpoint
- `src/services/spotify_service.py` - Better error handling

### New Features:
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
